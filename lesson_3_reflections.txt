Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork is used when you need a copy of some else's project right on your own github account
Clone is used when you want a local copy of a remote on your local machine
Branch is used either from local or remote in case of trying out a new functionality 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
Just in case you are offline and you need to checkout your commit against the orgin/master branch
